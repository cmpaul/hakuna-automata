Last week I built [oblique-strategies](https://atom.io/packages/oblique-strategies), a package for [Atom](https://atom.io/) that displays a random aphorism if you stop typing for some time.

Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt published a deck of cards in 1975 called [Oblique Strategies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies). When you need inspiration, draw a card at random to read a strategy for thinking about a problem.

Earlier this month, I read Kevin Lawlerâ€™s [Oblique Strategies: Prompts for Programmers](http://kevinlawler.com/prompts) and decided to create this package that would do this for programmers.

If you're OK with the (configurable) interruption, think of it as a way to promote lateral thinking and break creative blocks.
